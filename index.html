    <h4><em>Introduction to Algorisms</em></h4>
    <p>Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to writing a best-selling textbook.
       <br> Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <em> Introduction to Algorithms:</em></p>
    <dl>
        <dt><em>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</em></dt>
        <dd>The fourth edition was releases on 5 April 2022. The <a href=""> MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to sites that sell it.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><em>Where can I find a list of errata?</em></dl>
    <dd>For the forth edition, we naintain an <a href="">errata page</a> that allow you to list errors by date, by page, or by serverity.</dd>
    <dd>For the second and third edition, we maintained an <a href="">erra page</a>that allows you to list error by date, by page, by sererity, or by discoverer. There os even an increasemental update feature, allowing you to list error posted since the last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</dd>
    <dt><em>Do you correct error?</em></dt>
    <dd>Yes. Each time new printing is product, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time. The <a href="">errata page</a>indicates in which printing each error was corrected.</dd>
    <hr>
    <strong><em>Algorisms Unlocked</em></strong>
    <p><em>Algorisms Unlocked</em>is a gentler, less technical, entry into algorithms than <em>Introduction to algorisms.</em> It contains some mathematics, butnot nearly as deep as in <em>Introduction to Algorithms.</em> The Amazon site for the boo is <a href="">here</a>, and the MIT Press site is <a href="">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Imaintain an <a href="">errata page</a> for <em>Algorithms Unlocked</em>. If you find an error in the book and it's nit already in the <a href="">errata page</a>, send email to <a href="">algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu</a>. (The email address in the preface of the book is incorret--the first known error in the book.)</p>
    <p><em>Algorisms Unlocked</em>is the <a href="">10,000th book title published by MiT Press</a>.</p>
